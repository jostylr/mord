    <h3>The Emerald Hall</h3><p>Wow, I did it. I have been allowed into the feast of heroes. The emerald doors have opened to me. No longer an outsider.</p>
<p>In the morning after the night in the cave, we could hear the orcs closing in. There was no way out there.</p>
<p>I prayed to Kord: &quot;Kord, take us back to New Ardlord, your temple and away from these orcs.&quot; And in a moment, we were stepping onto the grounds of the temple. So far from those orcs, Fiola&#39;s mission done, my rescue of her successful.</p>
<p>And so I came home for the first time. I saw my mom. She looked happy to see me, though I could see still much pain in her eyes. She seemed to struggle the whole time with something, almost as if she wanted to tell me. I kept hearing her mutter, &quot;Not yet. He is not ready yet. Soon. So soon.&quot;</p>
<p>Fiola is going through stuff too. She returned a hero, the tales of her deeds well known at the temple. Apparently, she had done quite a bit.</p>
<p>Me just a hero by rescuing her. Tales of my deeds are not yet the tales of legends. But still, they gave me a seat in the emerald hall, next to Fiola. We ate there for the few days I was there. The food is glorious, filling me with the warmth and strength of Kord. It is hard to go back, but I must rejoin with the dwarves. The temple elders tell me that it is important that I continue on that path. And so I shall.</p>
<p>Fiola is recovering. Her body has been healed, but her spirit will take some time. She told me she needs time to herself.</p>
<p>So I leave, I go back. I drink dwarven ale and fight giants. This I do. But my heart, my heart will remain here.</p>
<p>I said my good-byes and wafted away.</p>
<p>Mords of Wisdom: Time, not magic, heals the spirit.</p>
