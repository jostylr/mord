    <div role="main"><h2>King Falla…fella?</h2><p>So me and my mates were in an elven place. It was nice. They had elven wine which was okay. They had lots and lots of food that I kept eating. So on our way to this elven place, we were attacked by dark elves. A dog died. I erected a monument to said dog. But the dark elves later came back and removed it. I was sad. My friend, Barrel, was sad at the loss of his dog. Now he has a wolf. I like the wolf. I want to wrestle wolf but Barrel says no.</p>
<p>Anyway, when we got to the elves, we told them about dark elves. They did not believe us. They said &quot;Show us&quot;. So we marched back out and showed them. Then we marched back. Boring. I think. I was a bit muddled with elf wine. Anyway, we had a druid elf, Forget Me Soon, with us originally. Had a big bear. The bear I wrestled. That was fun. But elf went away. Which was fine. But bear went too. Mord sad.</p>
<p>Anyway, we are back in the elf city and the king calls us again. Why do kings call us? The king is King Fallas... something. I call him King Fella, your a heck of a nice fella. I rhyme!</p>
<p>Mords of Wisdom: Don&#39;t drink too much elf wine before meeting the king.</p>
