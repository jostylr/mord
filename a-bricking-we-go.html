    <h3>A Bricking We Go</h3><p>We flew hard and fast to Tackling. The dwarves had to know.</p>
<p>We found Tackling and suggested that we speak with him and A Brick. So dinner was arranged, which suited me just fine. Tackling hinted that there was also some big news in Carrot clan.</p>
<p>So we broke bread, ale, and table with Tackling, A Brick, and Far Cry.</p>
<p>&quot;So what news have you for us?&quot; gruffed out A Brick.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we know our news. But we do not know your news,&quot; I replied.</p>
<p>A Brick looked puzzled, counted to ten on his fingers, drunk some ale, and then, &quot;Very good, then. Much to my surprise, Carrot clan has adopted the name of A Brick clan.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s quite an honor. But isn&#39;t it customary for the name to be the leader&#39;s name?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed. It is the custom. And the custom holds.&quot;</p>
<p>I looked at him puzzled. Then looked at the others. They were grinning and getting up to clap A Brick on the back. Then it dawned on me; A Brick was the new leader. I got up and gave him a great big Mord hug and whispered, &quot;Congratulations. Um, could you take care of a couple of pardons?&quot; He tilted his head, smirked, and nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, tell us your news,&quot; he demanded, already taking to his role as a clan leader.</p>
<p>So we told him of what we found,  the conscripted stone giant,  the long-time resident giants, the refugee camp, and the tales of the eastern monster continent.</p>
<p>Tackling and A Brick conferred and told us that they would think about what they could do.</p>
<p>And then we celebrated. In the morning, we head to the elves to see what they can do for us.</p>
<p>Mords of Wisdom: Always ask for a pardon as soon as you can.</p>
