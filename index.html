        <p>I, the wizard of techdom, have arranged for a direct line to the ancient great Mord.</p>
        <p>I know, I know. We all know about what Mord did and the lessons he taught all of us. But why not get the truth from the horse’s mouth, or, rather, the half-orc’s mouth.</p>
        <p>New to Mord blog? Start at the beginning when <a href="me-mord.html">Mord first starts talking to us.</a></p>
        <p>Returning? Get the <a href="toc.html">latest stories of Mord</a> and his party of brave adventurers. Live it as they live it, with that fear and excitement of not knowing what will happen next.</p>
