    <div role="main"><h2>Escape and Capture</h2><p>Well, I did succeed in rescuing Fiola. It did not go exactly as planned.</p>
<p>I got to the altar well enough, cut her ropes, and gathered her into my arms. Looking around, I saw no one. So I ran towards the forest. Halfway there, the alarm went off in the tribe. Someone had noticed. We were close to the forest, so close.</p>
<p>Fiola was still slumped over my shoulder. No time to heal her. Must run, going very fast now.</p>
<p>&quot;There they are. Over here.&quot;</p>
<p>I signaled to Kord to hide me and have my image run the other way.</p>
<p>&quot;They are turning, cut him off there.&quot;</p>
<p>And so it was that they pursued my image, while I ran in another direction. I splashed through a river and up into the hills. I could hear the worgs coming. They would not be fooled.</p>
<p>I paused a moment and healed Fiola. She stirred, opened her eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Mord! What are you doing here, where is my mace?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shhhhh. They pursue us still. Do you know of a place to hide?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hide? No. I do not hide. Since when are you a coward, cowering in the face of some orcs?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are over a hundred orcs out there. They have grown in numbers. And you are hurt, injured.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tis no matter, we must slaughter them. Tonight, especially. The chief and witch doctor must die. They have plans to...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quiet. I hear them.&quot; And I could hear they were closing in.</p>
<p>&quot;I welcome this, Mord. I will fight them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, Fiola, not like this. Get free. I will take them.&quot; And looking around, I saw that there was a lake that might shelter her. &quot;Kord, hold her. Let her breathe underwater.&quot; And so I froze her, though I could see her eyes seething. And hoping she could breathe, I picked her up and ran and threw her into the water. Well, that should do, I hoped.</p>
<p>And I turned to face my attackers. A dozen orcs had found me. I lit my sword and took to them. I killed three and a worg, before they finally tackled me.</p>
<p>&quot;Where&#39;s the female?&quot; this brutish orc asked, smacking me and spitting in my face.</p>
<p>&quot;I sent her away. I could send only one so she is gone, back to New Ardlord. You will not have her this night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then Gruumsh shall consume you. Boys, take him. I will take the sword.&quot; And he laughed, cruelty licking his face.</p>
<p>And so I find myself, strapped to the altar, just with this stone. I prepare to die. &quot;Kord, thank you for allowing me to rescue Fiola. May she have the wisdom to flee.&quot;</p>
<p>What is that smell? I see yellow vapors rolling along, orcs dying. Ouch, a stinging spray, ow, ow. Wait. My ropes, they are burning, I can, yes, just, so, &quot;Kord, give me my strength.&quot; And I burst my ropes.</p>
