    <h3>A Bero of Fish</h3><p>Bero turns the odd-looking slab of black metal and glass over in his hands as Mord looks over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;So, he called it a turtle neck?&quot; asked Bero.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.  Well, not the slab . . . his armor&quot; replied Mord.  &quot;As I said, he was a mage of some sort.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm.  And, I can speak to this, and it will remember what I say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.  It can also speak back to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can it see me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would not be surprised.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mind if I carry it for a while?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.  But you must give back tonight.  This is important to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will, I will.&quot;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The hangover was not so thick . . . certainly not as bad as he&#39;d expected it to be.  As Bero began to recall the night before, he heard a strange noise coming from his backpack on the floor next to his bed.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh shi . . . Mord&#39;s slab!&quot;</p>
<p>Bero removed the slab, and saw that the glass part, which usually showed Bero images of the world around him, was dark with the exception of some small symbols, some of which were vaguely arrow-like at the bottom.  As he lay in bed, slowly waking up, he began to tap at them.  Shortly, he had realized that he could review scenes from the day before, write things over top of the scenes, and even re-order them.</p>
<p>He rose out of bed, and ran down the hall to Mord&#39;s room.</p>
<p>&quot;Mord!  Mord!  Look at this!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Unh.&quot;  Then, a dull thud, followed by scraping noises.</p>
<p>&quot;Mord?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;UNH.  Barrel.  Away.&quot;</p>
<p>Bero cracked the door, peeking his head into the room.</p>
<p>&quot;That not what &#39;away&#39; means.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! . . . oh.  I&#39;ll round up some breakfast for us.  Come meet me in the pub in about 2 hours.&quot;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As they all sat around the table, munching on fish, Bero placed the slab on the table, and tapped the symbol that looked like an arrow pointing to the right.  The screen grew brighter, and a scene emerged.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Powerful</em> magic . . .&quot; said Bero, as they all watched . . .</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A forest in the early morning sun, a light fog dispersing.  The only sounds are birds, and nothing moves.</p>
<p>The stump of a fallen tree sighs, then emitts a shrill whistle.</p>
<p>A large wolf, silver with blue eyes, walks over the ridge about 50 feet away, and raises its ears, panning its head left, then right.</p>
<p>&quot;You, my dear, are as good as blind, aren&#39;t you?&quot; said Bero, as he stood up from the screen he&#39;d made for himself next to the stump.<br>He stretched, and looked around himself.<br>&quot;I&#39;m beginning to suspect that all of the living things in these woods have roots.&quot;</p>
<p>The wolf gave Bero an oddly appraising look, then turned and trotted back to the crest of the ridge where she gave a low &quot;wuh&quot; in Bero&#39;s direction.<br>She turned, and walked out of sight.<br>As he crossed the crest of the ridge, Bero could see Lusa standing at the edge of the stream, head down, ears up.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, are we <em>fishing</em> now?&quot;</p>
<p>A low . . . ever so low . . . growl.</p>
<p>&quot;My apologies,&quot; he whispered.  &quot;I&#39;ll try to keep it down nex. . . oh <em>good girl!</em>&quot; He saw what she saw, and slowly readied his bow and nocked an arrow.<br>There, simply treading water against the current, was the largest fish Bero had seen in months.  A dark, slender torpedo almost 3 feet long, lazily flicking it&#39;s tail back and forth.  Bero could just make out 5 dark stripes down it&#39;s side.  He guessed it was about a dozen stones, maybe more.</p>
<p>He drew a breath, pulled back the string.  <em>Aim high . . . the water will play tricks on you.</em></p>
<p>***<br>The slab smoothly faded to a scene they all recognized as the night before, in this very same pub . . .<br>***</p>
<p>As he tipped his head back, tapping on the bottom of the stein, Mord&#39;s eyes lit up with hope.  A single drop of ale perched on the edge of the mug, then dropped into his mouth.</p>
<p>Bero watched this from his seat next to Algrin.  Mord placed the mug on the bar, lowered his head and closed his eyes, almost as though saying a prayer.</p>
<p>Bero nudged the dwarf with his elbow, gesturing towards the half-orc.  &quot;Someone&#39;s purse has gone empty again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course it has!  He drinks like a horse at water!&quot;</p>
<p>Bero waved the barkeep over, and ordered another round of ale for the 5 of them.  When it arrived, he raised his mug to his friends and said, &quot;To strength!&quot;.</p>
<p>Mord got up from his seat, walked over to Bero (who he somehow managed to tower over at ALL times), and slapped him on the back hard enough to cause him to splash most of his drink out onto the barkeep, who was still waiting for payment.</p>
<p>&quot;Barrel, you much better at drinking than shooting.  But, you even better at toasting, I think!&quot; said Mord.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t suppose you won&#39;t charge me for that&quot; Bero said to the barkeep, sliding a few coins across the bar, being careful to avoid the puddles collected there.</p>
<p>&quot;This place was kept cleaner before you lot started showing up, and that&#39;s saying quite a bit coming from a dwarf&quot; muttered the barkeep, who made a show of cleaning the coins with a rag before dropping them into his purse.</p>
<p>Mord took the seat on the other side of Bero; the regular patrons of the bar seemed to be most comfortable with a little space between themselves and the party.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a secret for you, Barrel,&quot; Mord said with a smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Ber<em>O</em>, Mord.  <em>O</em>.  Do tell, though.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I still have money!&quot;</p>
<p>***<br>And now the slab faded back to Bero and Lusa by the side of the river . . .<br>***</p>
<p>*<em>TWANG!</em>*</p>
<p>The arrow flicked through the air, barely visible before breaking the water.  The fish never even reacted, just tread water, then stopped.  It began to drift downstream.  Bero smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;Fetch, Lusa.&quot;</p>
<p>She trotted out into the water, barely up past her chest, dove, and snatched at the fish.  She came up with the fletch of the arrow clutched in her mouth, the fish hanging from the shaft, which was running right through it&#39;s eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>That</em>,&quot; he said as he took the arrow from Lusa&#39;s grip, &quot;is more like it, wouldn&#39;t you say, girl?&quot;</p>
<p>He and Lusa walked side by side through the woods.  The arrow from which the fish hung was cleverly secured to Bero&#39;s belt.</p>
<p>Until recently, he and Lusa would often make the walk back to the city empty handed.  In recent weeks, they had become much more efficient hunters, almost always catching prey.  Usually Bero went after birds, collecting feathers for arrows and eating the meat before they returned; there was seldom enough for more than two, and Bero found that dwarves weren&#39;t too fond of eating the birds he caught. Lusa, on the other hand, loved them.  He did manage to find a goat on the mountainside one day.  Easy prey, not very exciting, and large . . . almost too heavy to carry back.  Tasty, in an odd way.  The dwarves seemed pretty happy to eat that.</p>
<p>He stopped walking, took a deep breath, and looked at the forest around himself as a hint of a smile came to his lips.</p>
<p>***<br>Back to the pub . . .<br>***</p>
<p>&quot;Mord, did you know I was in the army back home?&quot; asked Bero.</p>
<p>The pile of empty glasses had gotten quite large, and the barkeep had let slip that there was a cask of whiskey behind the bar.  He was unsure that this had been a wise decision, but it seemed to be mellowing the group out so far.  Some of the dwarves in the pub had actually moved closer to try to overhear some of their conversation.</p>
<p>&quot;_Nobody _knows much about you, Bero,&quot; said Algrin.</p>
<p>&quot;This is true.&quot; said Mord.</p>
<p>&quot;Fair enough . . . it&#39;ll come as a great surprise to you to know that I was an archer.  One of hundreds in my battalion.  I . . . stop laughing Mord . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can not . . . &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He can&#39;t stay in here if he&#39;s going to lie on the floor like that&quot; said the barkeep.</p>
<p>&quot;Get up Mord . . . it&#39;s not _that _funny.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry . . go on Barrel.  I will listen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>O</em>, Mord.  <em>BerO!</em> As I was saying, one of hundreds.  We were trained to fire in unison, in formation.  It was . . . awful.  In two whole years of war, I never once laid eyes on my enemy.  Not even their dead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s . . . odd&quot; said Algrin.  Bero nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Before I joined up, I was a hunter.  My father and I would go out for days at a time, living off what the woods would provide, bringing back meat and furs to sell.  I wasn&#39;t all that bad, either . . . but those two years in the army made me soft . . . I only ever marched and shot at an enemy I couldn&#39;t see.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who was the enemy?&quot; asked Algrin.</p>
<p>&quot;We were told that our borders were being overtaken.  Orcs, by the thousands.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This story is not as funny anymore&quot; said Mord.</p>
<p>&quot;Agreed, friend.  My father and I joined out of a sense of duty . . . the least we could do for our country, and all that.  We were lied to, though.  The orcs were never trouble before . . . we didn&#39;t get along great with them, but we had no dispute with them and our borders were peaceful.  Rumor started to circulate that we were used as part of a push to expand the realm, nothing more.  There were no attacks on our borders until <em>we</em> provoked them.  I have no idea how many were felled by my bow, but they were likely killed wrongly.  When we found out, I deserted.  My father . . . stayed.  For the better part of a year, I was lost, hunted, and very confused.  Then, I overheard you,&quot; nodding at Algrin, &quot;talking about coming here, and I thought, <em>&#39;why stay here?&#39;.&quot;</em></p>
<p>&quot;To right what is wrong!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But how could I?  You&#39;ve been with me for the past few months, you&#39;ve seen how weak I was.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is true.  You would be dead now.&quot; said Mord.</p>
<p>&quot;Mord, I am indeed lucky to be here to tell the story still.  I hope to return someday, but right now, although I love my home dearly, my home does not love me.  In the meantime, I believe I have a calling here.&quot;</p>
<p>***<br>The scene fades to Bero, walking alone . . .<br>***</p>
<p>Bero walked along the ridge, watching for the tree he&#39;d been using as the marker for the entrance to the city.  He found it with ease, but the mountainside beside him look utterly unfamiliar, just as it did every time.  Bero listened for a moment, picked up a pebble, and threw it into some shrubs to his right.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, yeah, yeah,&quot; came a voice from the shrubs, followed shortly by a guard, buckling his belt.  &quot;Can a dwarf piss in peace?!&quot;</p>
<p>Bero smiled and held up his catch.  &quot;I&#39;ve brought some fish!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oi!  Right through the eyes like that, too! . . . Lusa coming?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She&#39;ll be along.&quot;</p>
<p>They walked along the ridge for a bit, eventually turning into the moutainside entrance to the city.  Lusa came running up shortly thereafter, found the entrance with ease, and followed them in.</p>
