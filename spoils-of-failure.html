    <div role="main"><h2>Spoils of Failure</h2><p>So the king called us up and we had to tell him what we had done. His people were impressed with our bravery. I was sad. WE FAILED to save the elf lady. I was not strong enough. I must work harder. I must save someone.</p>
<p>King Fella is a heck of a nice fella. He give Barrel a new pair of boots. They looked like nice soft boots. Now Barrel can sneak up on me and I do not hear him. I am thinking of getting a bell and tying it around his neck. Use a Kordian knot?</p>
<p>All Grins got a shiny ring. It takes me longer now to beat All Grins at arm wrestling. He is so short. How can he compete with me.</p>
<p>Pitter got a nice club. I mean, a really nice club. It looked like it was nice.</p>
<p>The king turned to me and said &quot;You eat a lot&quot; and gave me a ring.  I grinned and said &quot;Is this food?&quot; Before he could respond I tasted the ring. Not very tasty. He said &quot;No, just wear it.&quot; Oh, and so I put it on my finger. It looks nice. I am not as hungry or sleepy as I used to be. I had heard of such things before. Kord&#39;s athletes sometimes use them to train for a long time. They get strong and fast. I hope I can still enjoy eating hogs and drinking ale.</p>
<p>After that, he asked if we were going to continue up North to dwarven country. We said yes. All Grins and Pitter want to go. I like to go anywhere. Barrel seems to like All Grins. Me wonder.</p>
<p>Fella told us that he wanted us to take his son with him. Apparently his son has issues so now we get to baby-sit. Very sad. But son seems nice. Not sure what problem is. He is Air And Wander. I will call him Air.</p>
<p>My drinking buddy Napkin is also going with us. He is a gnome and has traveled far and wide. He told Mord all about it during an all-night drinking binge.</p>
<p>So now we leave the elves and head to the dwarves. Apparently, there is a giant war there. That sounds more fun. Mord like to fight steel, not magics and posions like those dark elves.</p>
<p>Mords of Wisdom: Kings have nice stuff.</p>
