    <div role="main"><h2>Save the Elf</h2><p>So we attended Core&#39;s remembrance. I was an honorary honor guard, allowed to carry my weapon, the weapon Core had made. In attendance were the heads of the dwarven community and so many others. But a great elf had joined us as well, to pay the elven respects. Apparently Core had once done some great deeds for them as well.</p>
<p>As I listened, I felt this weight. Suspicious eyes glanced in my direction. I was the last one to see him, I was there and let this great dwarf fall. I was the reason, mysterious reason, why he was out. I could see ugliness in many of their eyes. And I was sad as their eyes reflected my own heart.</p>
<p>But then it was over and they left. A few stayed behind for the final respects. The elf was among them as was I. Barrel stayed around too though I don&#39;t know why. He never seemed to really trust Core. But it seemed he wanted to be near the elf, I felt.</p>
<p>As we were about to leave, I heard it, a chanting, a chanting I had heard before. This was not good. I yelled, &quot;Duck&quot; and I threw myself on the closest person to me which was the elf. My body covered him as the fireball scorched us in the room. I took the full brunt, but he was unharmed. Others in the room were not so lucky. Many were writhing in pain.</p>
<p>Barrel seemed to be doing well, though. &quot;Barrel, take the elf to safety. Be wary, I think he might be the target. An elf dead in the dwarven halls. I will hunt down this coward.&quot;</p>
<p>And I brandished my sword and took off down into the catacombs. I could see torchlight ahead and I followed. And then I felt it, that cold of undeath. I prayed to Kord to give me the power to destroy the undead. My sword glowed and I started attacking the hordes. My blows struck, severing them, disrupting them, burning through their ranks. I made it through, fire blazing in my eyes, aching all over.</p>
<p>Still I strode on. I stalked my quarry. I almost had him, but then he threw a web at me. I got entangled. I prayed for freedom and got free, but it was too late. I saw the mage slip through a door, it clicked shut with a finality that I knew I could not get through.</p>
<p>Defeated, I walked back. The room had been cleared and Barrel had escorted the elf out. Apparently, they started talking and became good friends. The elf offered to repay us. I said I did not need anything, but his eyes twinkled. Barrel seemed happy at the thought and offered his bow to the elf.</p>
<p>The elf departed and a few weeks later, he came back. He gave Barrel his bow back and it looked nice.</p>
<p>&quot;Look at these carvings. Look at these strips of dark wood. You know what they do right?  Feel these strings. Amazing! See their quality. Hold it here; that new leather in the center is something to behold. And you know, at night, sometimes, I think it glows a dull orange.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Barrel. Very nice bow. I know you have shown it to me, but I not see no glow. Here, have another ale.&quot; And so it went on. Barrel was so excited. I was happy for him, but joy was not in my heart right now.</p>
<p>As for me, the elf gave me a nice shirt. My old one was pretty ripped apart, by fire and the undead. This one, when I wear it, well, I seem to be able concentrate better. I like it. The elves do nice work even if they are a bit boring.</p>
<p>And so the days go on. I think I need a change or a challenge. I miss Core.</p>
<p>Mords of Wisdom: There is no safe place. Be ready.</p>
