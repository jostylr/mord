    <h3>Me Mord</h3><p>Hi. Me Mord. I not big on words, but silly wizard-man from future say I should write. So he gave me a book and I said, &quot;Write?&quot; He groaned. Then I said, &quot;I can speak&quot;. And he grumbled. I think he not happy.</p>
<p>He vanished in a poof of smoke and then he came back while I was eating a hog. It was just a small hog. It was tasty. Mmmm...spit-roasted hog with a tankard of ale. That was good.</p>
<p>So wizard-man was standing in front of me and gave me a black stone. He said, &quot;Speak into this your thoughts and experiences and it will record what you say.&quot; I say &quot;okay&quot;. But then I wonder. Why? So I say, &quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p>Hi sighes deeply. &quot;Mord, this may be hard for you to believe, but those words of wisdom of yours that have survived the centuries still warm the hearts and minds of many of Kord&#39;s followers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So you are from the future?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, and I have been tasked with getting more of your, uh, words of wisdom.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay. I just speak into stone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, and, Mord, do not tell anyone about this. If you do, the repercussions on the future could be dramatic.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They have drums in the future? Again? At plays? What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Speak and be silent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay. Will you leave now? I have hog to eat.&quot;</p>
<p>And just like that he disappeared. Now where did my mead go to? I got more hog to eat!</p>
<p>Mords of Wisdom: Hog is mightier than the future.</p>
