    <div role="main"><h2>A Brick Cometh</h2><p>So there I was, standing tall with Pitter, long shadows casting over Door Lick, when I see Barrel and the rest come down the path leading a tall dwarf. Or rather, a dwarf taller than most dwarves. Still short.</p>
<p>So they come over and apparently the dwarf is captain of the guard. His name: A Brick. Sounds like a name that will be thrown down the halls of history and break a few windows on the way.</p>
<p>So he comes up and starts questioning Pitter. All Grins says that Pitter has proven himself. It was kind of obvious, really. I mean, he is covered in giant blood after all. True, most of it is his, but still our enemies blood stenches up our clothing and weapons.</p>
<p>One of these weeks, I must really wash the grit of travels off. I don&#39;t like washing but smelling like my enemies is not fun. Smelling like roast boar and dribbled ale, now that&#39;s my kind of smell.</p>
<p>After some thought and Pitter&#39;s nice speech about peace and all that, A Brick let&#39;s Pitter in. I had stayed quiet since it was really all about Pitter. But then I introduced myself:</p>
<p>&quot;I am Mord. I serve my lord Kord with my greatsword. And my strength and my steel are at your service.&quot;</p>
<p>And you know what the little runt did? He laughed. I was offended. I give him my pledge, I speak of the great Kord, and his response: laughter.</p>
<p>Now mind you, I enjoy a good laugh. But not when it is about my lord Kord. I grimaced and asked him to explain himself.</p>
<p>He stuttered a bit and then he said that he was just happy to have such worthy allies and why don&#39;t we all go in and have a feast?</p>
<p>I clapped him hard on the back and said, &quot;Yes, let us toast to our mutual good health and fill our bellies with that thick dwarven ale.&quot; And then I turned to Door Lick and yelled, &quot;See you when your shift ends; enjoy your good health until then.&quot;</p>
<p>And then we went off and feasted well. Pitter had some dark looks thrown at him and I menaced in a protective way. But the guards relaxed as A Brick showed his support.</p>
<p>All in all, he does seem to be a decent fellow.</p>
<p>Mords of Wisdom: Dwarven ale is brutal--try it!</p>
