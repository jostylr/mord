    <div role="main"><h2>Soul Ale, Old Tale</h2><p>&quot;Starg. What to do wtih Starg.&quot; I mumbled into my ale.</p>
<p>&quot;Who is Starg?&quot; asked All Grins.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s the half-orc that tried to kill Mord the other night. Rotting in a dwarf cell now,&quot; replied Barrel. &quot;Of course, why he was trying to kill Mord, I do not know. Mord is a bit tight-lipped.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps another ale will part my lips,&quot; I replied with a knowing look. And so appeared another ale. And I told my tale.</p>
<p>It is hard to speak about it. Starg and I used to be the best of friends. He and I were a team, doing everything together. Our chores, our practice, our jokes, us, us, us. But Starg always had a bit of a cruel streak. I overlooked it, but it was there.</p>
<p>One day, an older half-orc bullied us. He pushed me out of the way, knocking me senseless. He took Starg and beat him mercilessly. I later found out that it was because Starg made fun of that boy&#39;s mother. But I did not know that then.</p>
<p>We decided to set a trap for this boy. Just a little something involving some ropes and some daggers. We were setting it up in a place that we were sure no one would enter. But someone did. Fiola. She stepped right into our trip string setting off the hail of daggers. I lunged forward, tackling her. I do not know what Starg was doing, but he was hit fully with the daggers.</p>
<p>One of those daggers punctured his eye. He was near death. I raced over and picked him up, running to the clerics. They healed him, but not his eye. They needed a more powerful cleric for that.</p>
<p>The head of the temple came down and asked us what happened. Starg stepped forward and said that he and I had been just walking around and noticed something odd. We saw this string and noticed it was attached to a devious device. So we tried to disarm it. But Fiola had stumbled into the place before we had finished it.</p>
<p>Then the head turned to me and said, &quot;Is this true, Mord?&quot;</p>
<p>I looked at Starg who was pleading with me in his one good eye to back him up. I looked at the head of the temple. Back and forth, sweat dripping from my forehead. The cleric&#39;s eyes grew narrow and asked again, asked me in the name of Kord.</p>
<p>I bowed my head and mumbled, &quot;No.&quot; Crushing pain came over me. I could not lie to my temple, to my lord Kord. But to betray my friend. He needed me. Betrayal. That is what I gave Starg. My last parting gift.</p>
<p>Starg&#39;s face spasmed with disbelief, rage, and hatred. In a single, solitary moment, I had lost my best friend. And worse, the head of the temple forbade the healing of Starg&#39;s eye for the lie he told. And he banished Starg from the temple until the day that Starg understood how a true Kordian would have handled that situation. Laying traps was not the path of Kord.</p>
<p>And so it was that Starg left in shame, with one eye, and hatred in his heart. I had betrayed him, I had broken our friendship, I had forsaken him for the sake of Kord.</p>
<p>And thus, my enemy was born.</p>
<p>I told this to my friends. And they were silent. Well, All Grins was snoring, his beard soaked in ale.</p>
<p>Their response: &quot;Move on. You betray us like that, we would want to kill you too. Have you even apologized?&quot;</p>
<p>Ah, ale, you still love me, don&#39;t you?</p>
<p>Mords of Wisdom: Best not to talk of betrayal to your friends.</p>
