    <h3>Tackling the Underwater Dwarves</h3><p>So in the morning Far Cry came to our campsite. He looked solemn and happy. Barrel had just caught some fish and we were frying up some breakfast.</p>
<p>While we waited for breakfast, wrestling happened. Both Pitter and Far Cry started to wrestle me. It threw me off balance a bit and Pitter has gotten quite good and strong. I fear that soon he will beat me regularly. Like Core did. But the true contest was with Far Cry. I relished this. He looked so like he needed to be thrown down. And so I tried. But he just seemed to slip through my fingers and then he had me pinned. He was good. Real good.</p>
<p>I arose, thanking him, and shaking my head, I wondered what was wrong with me now. Ever since Core beat me, I have had a hard time wrestling. I look forward to trying out these water dwarves.</p>
<p>Anyway, Far Cry said that Tackling would see us. I scratched my head and said, &quot;Who?&quot; Far Cry said it was the leader of the underwater dwarf clan. And after a good breakfast, we went underwater again.</p>
<p>We went into this tunnel and followed Far Cry exactly; Pitter stumbled and fell into a pit trap. But he was okay.</p>
<p>Then we got to meet Tackling. I was about to tackle Tackling when Barrel caught my eye and shook his head. No fun.</p>
<p>Tackling was a fine looking dwarven head of the clan. His plate mail was a bit dusty, but in fine condition. As if it had never seen battle, even. They had been out of communication for a long time. But they were ready to rejoin the world, it seemed.</p>
<p>So we began the process of arranging for talks with these folks. I talked with A Brick with the help of Kord and they are preparing the diplomatic chambers and feasts and celebratory ales as we sit here. We will stay here for a time and then escort the delegates to the Carrot Clan.</p>
<p>Mords of Wisdom: Dwarves do not get out much.</p>
